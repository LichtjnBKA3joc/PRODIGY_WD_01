# Responsive Landing Page Project

## Internship Milestone

I'm happy to share that I have received my internship offer letter, and as my first task, I was assigned to create a responsive landing page — and I’m glad to document the journey here

## Responsive Landing Page

A responsive landing page is a web page that adapts its layout and design to look and work great on all screen sizes — from desktops to smartphones. It enhances user experience by maintaining readability, usability, and visual consistency across devices.

## What I Created

This landing page consists of four key sections:

- Home – Introduction with a centered hero message  
- About – Overview with structured right-aligned content  
- Services – A clean list of offerings  
- Contact – Simple, accessible contact information

## Technologies Used

- `HTML5`
- `CSS3`
- `JavaScript`
- `VS Code`

## Features

- Fully responsive layout using flexbox and media queries
- Fixed navigation bar with scroll-based styling
- Hover effects for navigation links
- Section-specific alignment for improved visual flow
- Professional, cohesive color palette
